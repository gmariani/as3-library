	The C-level extensibility mechanism was introduced in Macromedia Flash MX 2004, and did not change in Flash 8. 
	The only revision in Flash CS3 is a change in the mm_jsapi.h file included in the sample DMG or ZIP file (see Sample DLL implementation).

For example, you might want to define a function that performs intense calculations more efficiently than JavaScript does, which improves performance, or when you want to create more advanced tools or effects.
